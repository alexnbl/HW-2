                   Hello I'm Alex! I'm a thirty-something who has a passion to learn and explore the world. Since I was a child I always wanted to travel. By the end of elementary school I had a two-page bucket list of all the places I wanted to go. As a teenager and young adult I always wanted to study abroad. Alas it was not meant to be. </p>
                    <p>
                   Instead I started taking the occasional trip here or there with any friend or relative I could. I quickly came to realize that many of the people I know could not travel due to family obligations or lack of funds. They did not have a travel piggy bank like I did. So I was stuck with a hard decision, go it alone on my travel exploits or find a group of fellow travelers to hit the pavement. I did not want to travel alone. I've read several travel blogs where they will just pack a bag and go. That is something I have never wanted to do. I've always imagined myself with other people even if they were strangers as I explore. As a result I started planning, budgeting, and saving. Once I had my game plan I started traveling. I started with cruises and have now branched out to international trips. I've met some wonderful people on the trips I've gone on and have grown leaps and bounds. </p>
                    <p>
                   I have experiences to reflect upon for the rest of my life. It's the experiences that really make up our memories and the stories we tell. 15 years from now I won't be telling my family about the shoes I had in 2018 instead I'll be telling them about the first time I went to France. You don't talk about the shoes you own the clothes you've worn or even the car you drove but you do talk about the people you've met the places you've gone and the things you've seen over and over again. </p>
